  <h2>Osborn Del Angel</h2>
  <p>Hi , my name is Osborn Del Angel. My background is in manufacturing and I decided to switch careers because I wanted a more fulfilling career. My daughter and my wife are also both driving factors and why I chose to be a software developer. Software Development is something that I'm ready to tackle and build my skills for the rest of my life. What I do to relax is just turn on some tunes and just listen.</p>
