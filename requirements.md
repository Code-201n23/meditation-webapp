# Software Requirements
## Vision




## What is the vision of this product?
The vision of this product is to help those that have been working long hours or just need a quick break from their job, to also prioritize their mental health by providing the user with a breathing exercise and meditation video customized to their needs. Sometimes, we can be so engulfed on a certain task or stare at a screen for hours, that a breather is necessary.


## What pain point does this project solve?
This provides a way for users to decompress and take time out of their day to meditate, regardless of the amount of time they have. A great feature of this app is that the user can select the amount of time they’d like to relax and will only be presented with a video that falls within that time allotment. Finally, the app provides a personal experience for each user, based on their name, occupation, and what they like to relax with.
Programmers are very dedicated to their work. We are providing a way for programmers and others in stressful positions to take a structured break from their work in a way that is easy to use.


## Why should we care about your product?
You should care about this product because it’s providing a pivot to the saying “no days off”. It’s been normalized in society to have to work and be productive 24/7. It’s causing a neglect of our mental wellness, which can affect work productivity and also results in burn out. We want to make sure that others know it’s okay to take a breather or a break sometimes.
